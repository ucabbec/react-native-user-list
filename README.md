### React-Native-Redux application

Application gets users from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users api and lists them on mobile devices.

The app will make another call to the api when the user scrolls to the bottom of the list

Redux middleware updates the IDs ad email addresses to ensure no duplicates are created
